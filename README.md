    you can keep forever and remember throughout your life.

    march is a month that brings you happiness, even thougt it may not always be this month,but March will be one of the special
    month for you. Everything you have gone through is a challenge in life and also how things teach you about everything.

        Even though I may not always be by your side, I will always support you with my prayers and best wishes.
        When you feel tired or uncertain, remember that there is someone who always believes in you, who is always proud of every step you take, no matter how big or small.
        I will always be the one most proud of every step you take, every success, and even every failure. Because for me, seeing you strive and grow is a joy in itself.

    <p>With Taylor Swift's song echoing in my ears, I realised that you were the person I had been hoping for in 
    my life all along, even though I didn't realise it when I first met you.</p>
    <p>At that moment, I began to wonder whether this was my last love 
    or just someone who would pass through my life briefly. I admired you 
    because it seemed as if all goodness was gathered in your soul and body.</p>
    <p>And I was moved by a lyric that goes: Please don't 
    be in love with someone else, please don't have someone waiting on you.</p>
    <p>A lyric that I interpreted to mean that you should not love and wait for another woman 
    besides me while we are in a long-distance relationship, because I only want you to be mine forever and for 
    me to be the only one you wait for and love for the rest of your life.</p>
    <p>I hope that love will guide you to good things and not make your life complicated.</p>
